            <p>Hello, there! </p>
            <p/>
            <p>
                My name is Gabriel, I am a freshman at the University of Pennsylvania. I am currently majoring in Computer Science at the School of Engineering 
                and Applied Science, and I am also really interested in finance, entrepreneurship, education, and AI. Thus, I plan on concentrating in Artificial Intelligence 
                and minoring in Engineering Entpreneurship. 
                At Penn, I am a Blue Dev at Spark, a member of EWB's operations team, and a student-assistant at the Museum Library.

                I was born and raised in Porto Alegre, which is a relatively large city in the south of Brazil. Growing up, I used to love to travel with my family to Uruguay, 
                cook barbecue and past with my dad, and play Pokemon in my Nintendo DS.
